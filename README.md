<h1>Description of the Project</h1>
This app generates filler text and filler users. It uses Twitter Bootstrap for its design, and it uses Ruby on Rails for its back end. The most challenging part of launching this app was configuring my DNS to point to this app on Heroku. My DNS is now pointing at two different servers. One server my DNS points at is my LAMP server hosted on digital ocean, the second one is obviously this app which is hosted on Heroku.
